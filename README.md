# D-D-Project
Lets Make it Advanced!

This is a program that I eventually want to advance into data structures and even possibly add stacks and queues that can be used.
I have started the program by creating a main function to perform a combat sequence which will eventually become a function call 
in the larger version of the project. I plan to include classes, menues, and additional loops for combat until eventually the oponent
has been slain.

Since this is an area I'm interested, I find it interesting and fun to create more or less text adventure while helping solidify my
coding skills in C++.
